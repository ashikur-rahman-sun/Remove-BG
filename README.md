# Erase BG (Mobile App-Android)
This project is a prototype mobile application named "Background Remover". It was built as part of my learning process in App Automation. The main goal is to simulate real-world user scenarios and validate app functionality using automation tools. 

This prototype helped me practice and implement mobile app automation ‚Äî from identifying UI elements to executing user flows across various devices and OS versions.

‚úÖ Why This Code Is Useful
Device & OS Independent:
The automation does not rely on a specific device or Android version. It can run on any available device, making testing flexible and scalable.

Realistic Scenarios Covered:
All scenarios reflect actual user behaviours. This helps ensure that the app works as expected in practical use cases.

üì∏ Key Scenario
üß© Title-1: A User Wants to Remove the Background From a Picture
Flow:
  1. Launch the app
  2. Tap on the Gallery Asset
  3. Select a Folder
  4. Pick Any Picture
  5. Tap on the Next Button
  6. Tap on the Export Button
  7. Tap on the Save to Gallery Button
  8. Tap on the Home Button
This flow is automated step-by-step and can be used to verify both UI responsiveness and backend processing.

üß© Title-1: Save an Image with a Heart Shape
Flow: 
  1. Launch the app
  2. Tap on the Gallery Asset
  3. Select a Folder
  4. Pick Any Picture

  6. Click Love Shapes Category
  7. Click on the Heart Shape
  8. Click the Done Button
  9. Tap on the Export Button
  10. Tap on the Save to Gallery Button
  11. Tap on the Home Button
  12. Closing the app

Try to Handle: 
1. Gallery Permission
2. Optional Review Dialogue

üß™ Features of the Automation
